It can be performed in low reps, such as 5-8 reps per set, to build shoulder strength, or for higher reps to build muscle and for conditioning. It can work as the main focus of a shoulder day but is also popular as an accessory movement to the bench press or barbell military press.",

The angle of the bench creates a greater range of motion than flat bench skullcrushers, as well as targeting the lateral head of the muscle. This exercise is usually performed for moderate to high reps as part of an upper-body or arm-focused workout.",

Dips can be performed for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.\",\"The ring dip is an upper-body strength exercise performed on gymnastic rings. It targets the muscles of the chest, triceps, and shoulders, but is also quite taxing to the core. It is generally considered to be more difficult than dips performed on parallel bars. It is common in gymnastics training and CrossFit workouts, but is also a simple way to make dips more challenging for any strength athlete.\",\"The feet-elevated bench dip is a popular bodyweight exercise for building the triceps, chest, and shoulders. Elevating the feet brings more chest and shoulder into the movement, but also allows for extra weight on the hips. If these bother your shoulders, try performing them between two benches or chairs rather than on a single bench.\",\"The bodyweight triceps press is an arm movement that involves performing overhead presses in a face-down position on a Smith machine or other raised bar. It is a surprisingly difficult movement that hammers all three heads of the triceps and the difficulty can easily be scaled up or down by moving the bar.\",null,null,null,null,\"The Russian dip is a chest-and-triceps building exercise that resembles the chest dip, albeit with a twist that makes it even harder and more taxing.\",\"The straight-arm plank with kick-back is a hybrid movement that trains the abdominal and triceps muscles simultaneously. It can address multiple muscle groups in a time-efficient muscle-building or circuit-style workout, while also providing an additional cardiovascular challenge.\",\"The triceps dip is a machine version of an exercise that many lifters perform using parallel bars or two parallel benches. The machine is found in many gyms.\",\"The bench dip is a highly effective exercise for building the triceps. The resistance comes from the body itself, rather than weight.\",\"The banded dip is a bodyweight exercise targeting the chest, triceps, and shoulders. This variation utilizes an exercise band to help support the lifter in the bottom part of the movement. This makes pushing out of the hole easier, and may combat the shoulder pain that some lifters feel when they perform dips. The top of the movement receives less help from the band, putting more stress on the triceps.\",\"The bench dip is a highly effective exercise for building the triceps.
